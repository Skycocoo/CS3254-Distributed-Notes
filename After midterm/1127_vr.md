# project

replication strategy: build infrastructure first: asynchronous messages

should avoid multiple threads using same TCP connection:
- one only goroutine to send messages (a channel of messages)
- another TCP connection just for heartbeat (okay for this class)
- each thread have its own TCP connection (slow, inefficient)
- best strategy?


# viewstamped replication

RAFT with easier election strategy (bulley to elect leader)

## roles

Primary (Leader), Secondary (Follower); logs with (un)committed messages

## leader election (bulley algo)

every node: id, timeout; node with lowest number would be the leader

## reconfiguration

viewstamped: related to reconfiguration (adding / removing nodes)

each node: have a view number; a node must to accept messages from a node that have a higher view number (each node should sync to the higher view number)



# pros and cons between different replication strategies

key: unstable network: leader instability (performance)

Multi-PAXOS: doesnt require leader (could default back to PAXOS)

RAFT: not designed to handle multiple log messages (need leader to handle messages; leader elections slow)



# distributed hash table

bucket number => node number (single point failure)

problem: reconfiguration: will mess up node number: could rehash / bigger space?

## keyspace partitioning (CHORD)

number 0 - 1024, want nodes approximately evenly distributed along the range (random number between 0 and 1024)

hask key: choose the next closest node to store (could wrap around: a circle for the range)

reconfiguration: when add new nodes: some keys may have to move to the new node / linear probing (slower)
