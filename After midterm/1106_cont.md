# midterm solution

spinlock
```go
    func (s *Spinlock) Lock() {
        for {
            test := 0
            Cmpxchg(&test, &s.held, 1)
            if test == 0 {
                break
            }
        }
    }

    // precondition for unlock: the lock is currently locked
    func (s *Spinlock) UnLock() {
        s.held = 0
    }
```

# consistency

maximize concurrency: causal consistency > sequential consistency > linearizability


## eventual consistency (more AP than CP?)

### replica synchronization

there might be discrepancy between replicas

### healing

e.g: votes on reddit: if update replicas for each upvote: slow; in short term: could tolerate inconsistency; in long term: should be consistent

versioning: update by the latest version

e.g: search results? update new website to the result of search?; email: mailbox;

### conflict

two replicas have different version of values

solution: upvotes: merge with union; shopping cart: client keep track of version number / client cache / ask for correct version

### quorum

quorum: majority of replica accessible (cannot have two intersecting majority)

cannot resolve conflict: if two replicas cannot communicate each other (network partition)

solution: if write, check whether the node can communicate to majority of replicas => a write send to a quorum of nodes

if read: query majority of the replica, and get the latest one
