# byzantine failure


## OM algorithms

### performance

when number of nodes is 6

- OM(0): 4 (assume no traitors (base case (send message)))
- OM(1): 5 + OM(0)
- OM(2): 6 + 6 * OM(1)


## Secure Message signing (SM)

public key & private key (RSA / ECC); encode(privateKey, v) => cipher text => decode(publicKey, cipher text) => v

original message + signature (encrypted hash of the message); check signature by decode the signature to get the value, and hash the message to make sure that the values are the same

### process

commander -> n messages to all lieutenant => all lieutenant send messages to others

=> need more signatures (verification) than the number of traitors (toleration of failure)


## Blockchain

shared public data across network (reliability; distriubted;) 

owner can modify their own data

send transaction with the hash of the previous transaction (the longest chain becomes the real chain)

need to make sure that the current transaction is valid before putting it on to the chain

bitcoin for each transaction (could be possibly changed to fake valid transaction) => valid block will ignore invalid block (but if the number of  invalid blocks overwhelm the valid block, then valid block will not be recognized)

=> should slow down the action to growth of the blockchain (need additional computation to add to the chain) 

=> the number of valid blocks should be more than the number of invalid blocks (51% attack)


hash (block + nonce (a number)) = (should start with a bunch of 0s); purpose: this hash should be rare enough (not actually useful)

proof of work (?) => centralization in bitcoin?

mining: validate the transaction for the community (the first finder earns)
