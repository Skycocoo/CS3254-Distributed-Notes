# distributed hash table

if wanna set key: 

- talk to one of the node, and that node would direct to the correct node (if the node have the correct view of the entire keyspace) => need to maintain correct and consistent view for every single node in the keyspace

- might be slow to do consensus for the view of the keyspace: could elect leader / cache nodes (like dns; but the value could be put in a wrong node) / ...

## circular linked list

each node only knows the left and right nodes

- if a node leaves: give all data to the next node

- if a node adds: (before with keyspace: rehashing every keys when node add into the current view) the next node gives a pile of keys that should belong to the current node

performance: search: would be O(n)

- could remember 1 nodes and k nodes away from current node

```
lookup(id):
	if id > pred.id && id < my.id:
		return my.id
	else 
		return succ.lookup(id)
```

### finger table (lookup)

each node: keep track of additional links: (n + 2^i) % m -> the corresponding node    i: number of finger links

look up: last finger link with the value that is lower than the entry looking for (still recursive, but not that expensive)

```
lookup(id):
	if id > pred.id && id < my.id:
		return my.id
	// fingers() by decreasing distance
	// linear search for fingers? (fingers in memory, reduce the number of network requests)
	for finger in fingers():
		if id >= finger.id:
			return finger.lookup(id)
	return succ.lookup(id)
```

if failed lookup: go to the previous node then search again

update finger link: when linear search


# byzantine failure

problem of PAXOS rule of not-changing chosen value: nodes are hacked / ... => arbitrary failure / byzantine failure

all lieutenant attack: win; all retreat: redo that tomorrow; some attack: fail

## roles

Lieutenant, Commander; could be traitor or loyal

## rules

- all loyal Lieutenants follow the same order (could not do like one lieutenant attack the other retreat) even if commander is traitor
- if the commander is loyal, every loyal lieutenant obeys his command
- no spoofing, synchronous network
