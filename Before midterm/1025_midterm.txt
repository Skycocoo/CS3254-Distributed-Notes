midterm:
    no multiple choices

    happened before:
        1. same process: event 1 happens before event 2
        2. diff process: P1 send message happens before P2 receive that message
        3. transitive rule: if e1 -> e2 and e2 -> e3, then e1 -> e3
    "concurrent": no happened before

    lamport lock / vector clock
        lamport lock:
            each process has their own counter (doesnt guarantee the scale of the number)
            increment local counter in send event
            update local counter when receive other counter (choose the larger one)

            doesnt guarantee happened before relationship if comparing timestamp

        vector clock:
            integer is total order; happened before is partial order
            group membership (node exit / enter a group)

            happened before: v1 -> v2 if all elements in v1 is â‰¤ those in v2


    failure:
        types:
            fail-stop: crash (not responding to any messages)
            fail-recover: lost some data (dependes on the application's state)
                from fail-stop to fail-recover:
                    application should only support fail-stop
                    if fail-recover: it should be a "new" node
            network partition: cannot reach to some nodes
            arbitrary; Byzantine: hacking / not working correctly

        detect:
            ping-ack:  ping ->    acknowledge <- (on-demand)
            heartbeat: ack with no ping          (on-going)

        attribute:
            accuracy: identify real failure
                inaccurate: incorrectly determine a node is down but its working (false negative)
            completeness: detect all failues
                incomplete: incorrectly determine a node is working but its down (false positive)

    file system:
        unix system:
            cursor (file pointer) should be managed
        NFS:
            specify offset for each operations
            client side stores file pointer
            (idempotent operations)
        AFS:
            store files locally, make local changes, and send the file back
        dropbox:
            local daemon
            write locally, daemon takes care of the update

        NFS: getattr: whether need to update local cached copy
        AFS: testAuth: same thing => server notifies all the servers that request the file (statefullness of the server)

    dining philosopher: order lock
